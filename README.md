### WTF?
Chimery is a small piece of software that allows you to set a schedule for chimes at regular intervals through-out your day.

### Build & Install
Chimery should be able to build and run on many platforms, including OS X, Linux and Windows.  It has currently only been built and tested on OS X, it may also work on the others.  It may even work on the mobile platforms Qt supports but it seems less likely to work correctly without any changes.  Chimery relies on the Qt Toolkit.  You will need to install it to compile and run Chimery.  The qmake command should generate the appropriate makefiles for your platform.  On most platforms, the make command will then compile a binary, on a few others qmake will generate something that makes sense for the platform.

### Credits and Acknowledgements
Chimery relied on the generousity of following artists:

* The logo image used for Chimery is from [uroesch](https://openclipart.org/user-detail/uroesch) who generously creates and uploads clipart in the public domain to [openclipart.org](https://openclipart.org/) for the entire world to use as they see fit.  [The main image used is this one](https://openclipart.org/detail/181388/japanese-wind-chime-at-night-by-uroesch-181388), which was derived from [a previous version](https://openclipart.org/detail/181387/japanese-wind-chime-by-uroesch-181387) they uploaded which is also used as an icon by Chimery during active work sessions.  This file lives in Chimery's source code management system in the art directory as a derived iconset called [chimery.icns](https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/chimery.icns), the original vector image called [chimerylogo.svg](https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/chimerylogo.svg) and a PNG version called [chimerylogo.png](https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/chimerylogo.png).  The images used during the "active" times are in the same art directory.
* The chime sound used to mark the beginning of time phases is from [reinsamba](http://www.freesound.org/people/reinsamba/) who creates and uploads sound to [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) for the entire world to use and remix under the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).  [This is the page on freesound.org for the sound file](http://www.freesound.org/people/reinsamba/sounds/46062/) and it lives in Chimery's source code management system in the art directory as [begin.wav](https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/begin.wav).
* The chime sound used to mark the end of time phases is from [itsallhappening](http://www.freesound.org/people/itsallhappening/) who creates and uploads sound to [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) for the entire world to use and remix under the terms of the [Creative Commons Sampling Plus 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/) license.  [This is the page on freesound.org for the sound file](http://www.freesound.org/people/itsallhappening/sounds/48796/) and it lives in Chimery's source code management system in the art directory as [end.wav](https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/end.wav).

Without these excellent sounds, Chimery would be useless and without the logo, Chimery would have no soul.  Thanks to the involved artists for helping chimery avert both of these situations.

Chimery code was written by [D J Capelis](http://capelis.dj).  This code is released to the public domain for anyone to use as they see fit.  Chimery's code is found in chimery's source code management system, which currently lives on [github](https://github.com).
