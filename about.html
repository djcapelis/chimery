<p>Chimery relied on the generousity of following artists:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The logo image used for Chimery is from uroesch (https://openclipart.org/user-detail/uroesch) who generously creates and uploads clipart in the public domain to openclipart.org for the entire world to use as they see fit.  The main image used is this one (https://openclipart.org/detail/181388/japanese-wind-chime-at-night-by-uroesch-181388), which was derived from a previous version (https://openclipart.org/detail/181387/japanese-wind-chime-by-uroesch-181387) they uploaded which is also used as an icon by Chimery during active work sessions.  This file lives in Chimery's source code management system in the art directory as a derived iconset called chimery.icns (https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/chimery.icns), the original vector image called chimerylogo.svg (https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/chimerylogo.svg) and a PNG version called chimerylogo.png (https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/chimerylogo.png).  The images used during the "active" times are in the same art directory.
    <li>The chime sound used to mark the beginning of time phases is from reinsamba (http://www.freesound.org/people/reinsamba/) who creates and uploads sound to freesound.org for the entire world to use and remix under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).  This is the page on freesound.org for the sound file (http://www.freesound.org/people/reinsamba/sounds/46062/) and it lives in Chimery's source code management system in the art directory as begin.wav (https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/begin.wav).
    <li>The chime sound used to mark the end of time phases is from itsallhappening (http://www.freesound.org/people/itsallhappening/) who creates and uploads sound to freesound.org for the entire world to use and remix under the terms of the Creative Commons Sampling Plus 1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/) license.  This is the page on freesound.org for the sound file (http://www.freesound.org/people/itsallhappening/sounds/48796/) and it lives in Chimery's source code management system in the art directory as end.wav (https://raw.github.com/djcapelis/chimery/master/art/end.wav).
</ul>

<p>Without these excellent sounds, Chimery would be useless and without the logo, Chimery would have no soul.  Thanks to the involved artists for helping chimery avert both of these situations.</p>
